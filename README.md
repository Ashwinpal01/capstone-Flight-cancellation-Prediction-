# Capstone Project -Flight-cancellation-Prediction-

Overview:
Traditional Flight Cancellation Flaws:  
Flight cancellations disrupt passenger plans, causing inconvenience and potential financial losses. It strain airport resources, impacting operational efficiency, and can harm an airline's reputation, leading to decreased customer trust. 
Letâ€™s Leverage Machine Learning :
Develop a machine learning model that predicts early whether a flight will be cancelled based on historical data, enabling the airline to take pre- emptive measures to minimize cancellations and optimize its operations.

BUSINESS INFERENCE:
1.Positive Influencers on Cancellation Probability:
   - Flights arriving at a destination at a later time (WHEELS_ON: 0.116894) and those in more recent years (Flight Year: 0.041553) tend to 
     have higher odds of being cancelled.
   - Longer CRS_ELAPSED_TIME (0.007258) are also associated with increased cancellation odds.
2.Contributors with Minimal Impact:
   - Features such as DEST, ORIGIN, CANCELLATION_CODE, and AIRLINE_CODE_en have relatively small coefficients 
    (ranging from 0.000019 to 0.000421), indicating minimal impact on the likelihood of cancellation.
3.Negative Influencers on Cancellation Probability: 
Delay factors like DELAY_DUE_WEATHER and DELAY_DUE_SECURITY suggested moderate impact on cancellation odds.
           -   Longer DISTANCE (-0.000130) and flights scheduled in certain months (Flight Month: -0.014948) are 
             associated with  slightly lower cancellation odds.

BUSINESS SOLUTIONS:
1.Optimize Operational Efficiency:
Focus on reducing Taxi In and Taxi Out times to improve operational efficiency. Although shorter times are associated with a slightly higher likelihood of cancellation, overall operational efficiency can be enhanced by streamlining ground operations and reducing taxi times without compromising safety.

2.Manage Delays Proactively:
Implement measures to minimize airtime, reduce departure delays, and ensure timely wheels-off times to decrease the odds of cancellation and enhance overall flight punctuality.

3.Weather and Seasonal Considerations:
Taking into account seasonal variations and weather conditions when scheduling flights. Although delay factors like DELAY_DUE_WEATHER have moderate impact on cancellation odds, we can consider their potential influence on overall flight operations.
